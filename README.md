The objective of this project is to create an efficient password manager app. The app will allow users to securely store their various login credentials for different accounts, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords. The interface of the app will be intuitive, ensuring users to efficiently navigate and manage their passwords. It will enable users to quickly access and organize their passwords while maintaining a sense of control. Users will of course have the option to add, edit and delete their entries. Furthermore, the app will include features such as password generation, enabling users to create strong and unique passwords for their accounts.
